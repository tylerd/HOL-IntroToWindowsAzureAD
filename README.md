# Introduction to Windows Azure Active Directory #

## Hands-On Lab ##

### Introduction ###

Hands-on labs are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn how to use key Windows Azure services and features.  Each Lab provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing a complete application.

In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use Windows Azure Active Directory for implementing web single sign-on in an ASP.NET application. The instructions will focus on taking advantage of the directory tenant associated with your Windows Azure subscription.

### Repository Structure ###

In the **root** folder of this repository you will find the hands-on lab (HOL) document, **HOL.md**. Before beginning with the HOL exercises, make sure you have followed all the required steps indicated at the setup section of the HOL document. 

In the **Source** folder you will find the source code of each of the exercises, as well as the assets and setup scripts. Throughout the HOL you will be instructed to open and explore the different solutions from the source folder. It is typically comprised of the following subfolders:

- **Assets:** This folder contains files that are used throughout the exercises.
- **_Exercise Name_:** Each exercise that requires a programming solution has its own code folder.
  - **Begin:** The begin solution is the initial incomplete solution that you will finish by following the steps of the corresponding exercise.
	- **End:** The end solution is the final result you will achieve at the end of an exercise.
- **Setup:** This folder contains the dependency files and the setup scripts necessary to initialize specific configurations of the lab, being its execution is required in the majority of the hands-on labs.
